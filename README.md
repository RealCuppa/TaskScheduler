# TaskScheduler
Task scheduler is a C programming language project that allows users to schedule tasks to be executed at a specific time or interval. The task scheduler is designed to be flexible and easy to use, and it can be used to schedule a wide variety of tasks, such as:

* Running scripts
* Performing system tasks
* Sending notifications
* Starting and stopping other applications

# Features

The task scheduler has the following features:

* Flexible scheduling options: Tasks can be scheduled to be executed at a specific time, interval, or even based on a complex schedule.
* Prioritization: Tasks can be prioritized so that more important tasks are executed first.
* Dependencies: Tasks can be configured to depend on other tasks, so that they are only executed after the dependent tasks have finished.
* Error handling: The task scheduler can handle errors that occur in tasks, and it can notify the user or take other corrective action.

# Usage

To use the task scheduler, you first need to create a task configuration file. This file specifies the tasks that you want to schedule, their scheduling options, and their dependencies. Once you have created the task configuration file, you can start the task scheduler.

The task scheduler will then monitor the time and execute the tasks that are scheduled to run. You can also manually start and stop tasks from the task scheduler interface.
